1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `download-all` from `clone.janet`, which will clone all packages into the `repos` folder.
3. You can probe the cloned repos with the functions in `sherlock.janet`. Examples are in the `(comment ..)` block.

Note: This uses `fd` to scan for files. If you want to use those functions, you have to install it.
